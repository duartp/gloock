# Gloock

Meet Gloock: a contemporary high-contrast serif typeface intended for display use.

Gloock's main focus was a smooth relationship between the thin and thick strokes. 

One way to achieve that was by using long serifs that create a bridge between some pairs of glyphs. 

It mostly shines in headlines but performs well anywhere in big sizes.

## About

Name's Duarte. I'm a young graphic designer from Portugal looking to make a career in art. 

I started craving typography last summer.

Ever since I thought it would be fun to craft my own. 

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://duartp.github.io/gloock-typeface.
