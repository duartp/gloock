Meet Gloock: a contemporary high-contrast serif typeface intended for display use.

Gloock's main focus is the smooth relationship between the thin and thick strokes. 

It's a perfect typeface for headlines and has a great performance anywhere in big sizes.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://duartp.github.io/gloock-typeface.
